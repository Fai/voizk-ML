# RawNet3 Integration with ezkl

This folder contains the exploration and integration of the RawNet3 model with the ezkl zero-knowledge proof framework.

## RawNet3 Model Overview

RawNet3 is a deep neural network model designed for speaker recognition tasks. It takes raw audio waveforms as input and learns to extract speaker-specific embeddings. The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers, bottleneck layers, and an attention mechanism to capture discriminative features from the audio data. RawNet3 has shown state-of-the-art performance on various speaker recognition benchmarks.

### Notebooks

This folder includes three Jupyter notebooks:

- `RawNet3.ipynb`: This notebook demonstrates the standalone usage of the RawNet3 model for speaker recognition. It loads a pre-trained RawNet3 model, preprocesses audio data, and extracts speaker embeddings.

- `RawNet3_ezkl.ipynb`: This notebook explores the integration of the RawNet3 model with the ezkl framework. It attempts to generate ezkl settings using the exported ONNX model of RawNet3. However, it encounters a limitation due to the following error:

```
RuntimeError: Failed to generate settings: [graph] [tract] Translating node #71 "If_109" If ToTypedTranslator
```

This error indicates that ezkl has difficulties handling conditional statements and control flow operations present in the RawNet3 model.

- `RawNet3_ezkl_onnx_optimized.ipynb`: This notebook aims to address the compatibility issue encountered in `RawNet3_ezkl.ipynb` by optimizing the exported ONNX model of RawNet3 to make it compatible with ezkl. It explores techniques such as ONNX export optimization and model preprocessing using tools like ONNX Optimizer. However, despite these efforts, the integration remains unsuccessful, and the same error is encountered:

```
RuntimeError: Failed to generate settings: [graph] [tract] Translating node #71 "If_109" If ToTypedTranslator
```

#### Error Explanation and Implications

The encountered error highlights the limitations of ezkl in handling complex operations and control flow structures commonly found in neural network models like RawNet3. The presence of conditional statements, such as the "If" node, poses challenges for ezkl's type translator, making it difficult to convert the model into a format suitable for zero-knowledge proofs.

The complexity of the RawNet3 model architecture, with its various layers and operations, further compounds the compatibility issues. The presence of unsupported operations and control flow structures in the model architecture makes it challenging to integrate with ezkl seamlessly.

General Limitations of ezkl with Neural Network Models
It's important to note that ezkl, being a zero-knowledge proof framework, may have limitations when working with complex neural network models like RawNet3. Some general limitations include:

- Supported Operations:

ezkl may not support all the operations and layers commonly used in neural network models. Complex operations like conditional statements, loops, and certain activation functions may not be directly compatible with ezkl.

- Model Complexity:

ezkl may struggle with highly complex neural network architectures that involve a large number of layers, parameters, and intricate connections. The computational overhead and memory requirements for generating proofs for such models can be significant.

- Proof Generation Time:

Generating zero-knowledge proofs for complex neural network models can be time-consuming, especially for larger models and datasets. The proof generation process may require substantial computational resources and may not be feasible for real-time applications.

- Model Modifications:

Integrating neural network models with ezkl may require modifications to the model architecture, such as simplifying or removing unsupported operations. These modifications can potentially impact the model's performance and accuracy.

### Conclusion

The integration of the RawNet3 model with ezkl using ONNX export optimization and model preprocessing techniques remains a complex challenge due to the limitations of ezkl in handling the model's conditional statements and control flow operations. The encountered error underscores the challenges in integrating deep learning models like RawNet3 with zero-knowledge proof frameworks like ezkl.

Addressing this compatibility issue requires further investigation and potential advancements in zero-knowledge proof frameworks to support complex neural network models effectively.

Future research and development efforts are needed to bridge the gap between complex deep learning models and zero-knowledge proof frameworks, enabling their seamless integration while preserving the models' performance and functionality.
